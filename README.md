# Diabetes_prediction
### INTERNSHIP project under Connecting Dream Foundation and Vodafone Idea Foundation's

## About the Project:
The project's problem statement revolves around the urgent need to develop a robust and accurate machine-learning model for the classification of patients based on their risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes, a chronic health condition, is on the rise globally, and early detection and intervention are paramount for effective management and prevention of complications. The goal is to classify patients into two groups: those at elevated risk of developing diabetes and those not at risk, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in targeted intervention strategies, and preventive measures, and ultimately improving patient outcomes in the realm of diabetes management.

## Data Pre-processing
### Handling Missing Values
Missing values in the dataset were addressed by filling them using both mean and median for the required features.
### Data Splitting
The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Trained
1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Applied Logistic Regression and achieved an accuracy of ~76%
   - also visualized model using ROC curve
2. **Random Forest:**
   - Utilized Random Forest for prediction, and the accuracy matched that of Logistic Regression.
   - visualized the model using graphiz lib
3. **XGBoost:**
   - Applied XGBoost and obtained the same accuracy, demonstrating consistency across models.
  
##  Future enhancement
1.**Enhancing the models can be achieved by utilizing a more balanced dataset that includes representative samples from both classes.**
2.**User Interface and Deployment**
3.**Leveraging deep learning algorithms to enhance the interpretability of the relationship with the outcome.**
