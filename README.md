### Connecting Dream Foundation and Vodafone Idea Foundation - INTERNSHIP project

## About the Project:
The project's problem statement revolves around the urgent need to develop a robust and accurate machine-learning model for the classification of patients based on their risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes, a chronic health condition, is on the rise globally, and early detection and intervention are paramount for effective management and prevention of complications. The goal is to classify patients into two groups: those at elevated risk of developing diabetes and those not at risk, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in targeted intervention strategies, and preventive measures, and ultimately improving patient outcomes in the realm of diabetes management.

**Project Description: Diabetes Risk Classification System**

**Problem Statement:**
The rising prevalence of diabetes poses a significant health challenge, necessitating efficient methods for early risk identification. Manual assessment of diagnostic parameters is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Objective:**
Develop an automated Diabetes Risk Classification System using machine learning to swiftly assess patients' likelihood of developing diabetes.

**Impact on Society:**
Early detection allows timely intervention, reducing the overall societal burden of diabetes-related complications.

**Proposed Solution:**
Utilize data preprocessing techniques, including imputation and scaling, followed by machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost for accurate risk classification.

**Technologies/Libraries Used:**
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Scaling:** Standard Scalar
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost
- **Metrics:** Classification Report, ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy 
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Workflow:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, impute with mean/median based on skewness, and scale the data.
2. **Modeling:** Train the system using Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost.
3. **Evaluation:** Utilize classification report, ROC curve, and confusion matrix for model assessment.
4. **Visualization:** Generate insightful graphs, including the Random Forest Classifier's decision-making process and an ROC curve for logistic regression 

This project streamlines diabetes risk assessment, offering a scalable solution for early intervention in a user-friendly manner.
  
##  Future enhancement
1.**Enhancing the models can be achieved by utilizing a more balanced dataset that includes representative samples from both classes.**
2.**User Interface and Deployment**
3.**Leveraging deep learning algorithms to enhance the interpretability of the relationship with the outcome.**
